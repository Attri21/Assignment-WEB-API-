    "ANS-1 APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definations and protocol.It is a type of software interface , offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification.For example-The weather bureau's software contains daily weather data.The weather app on your phone \"talks\" to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.\n",

    "* Increased Interoperability-API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other , regardless of their programming language. This enhances the interoperability between systems, allowing for the exchange of data and functionality.\n",
    "*Improved Efficiency: API driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from existing software systems, saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "*Better User Experience: APIs can enable third-party developers to create applications that integrate with existing software systems, providing a better user experience and increased functionality."

    "ANS-4 *REST: (Representational state transfer) is a set of architectural principles attuned to the needs of lightweight web services and mobile applications.When a request for data is sent to a REST API, itâ€™s usually done through hypertext transfer protocol.Once a request is received, APIs designed for REST can return messages in a variety of formats: HTML, XML, plain text, and JSON.JSON (JavaScript object notation) is favored as a message format because it can be read by any programming language , is human- and machine-readable, and is lightweight.RESTful APIs are more flexible and can be easier to set up.\n",

However, these standards also offer built-in compliances that can make it preferable for enterprise scenarios. The built-in compliance standards include security, atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), which is a set of properties for ensuring reliable database transactions.\n",
